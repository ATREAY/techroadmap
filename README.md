# Tech Roadmap

‚≠ê Please click the star above on our repo, it keeps me motivated.

[Tech Roadmap](https://techroadmap.netlify.app) is a free online resource on careers in the tech industry. 
Anyone who wants to break or transition into the tech industry or has already broken into it, 
can use these resources to choose and define their career path and learn about the skills needed to build themselves in the chosen career.

## About The Project
Tech Roadmap lets you have access to collections of ebooks, videos, articles, guides, etc on different careers in the tech industry including the no-code jobs. 
So if you are looking for resources either for yourself or someone else about the beginning and growing a tech career, then Tech Roadmap is definitely the place to start.

The roadmaps or step-by-step guides are carefully curated for the different Tech Careers listed on our websites. And the collections of resources are carefully arranged 
so that the learner has a guided learning path.

You can read more about what inspired Tech Roadmap in my [article](https://blog.timonwa.com/tech-roadmap-everything-you-need-to-help-you-choose-and-learn-a-career-in-tech).

## Project Status
Tech Roadmap is live with the first roadmap created ([Frontend Development Roadmap](https://techroadmap.netlify.app/html/careers/frontend.html)).

I am working on adding more quality roadmaps on other Tech Careers. Anticipate! üòÅ

The project is currently built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Soon all data will be removed from the html pages and placed into corresponding Json files to have cleaner html documents.

Readmes will also be created for each roadmap so that one can also have copies of the resources on GitHub by forking the repo.
 
It will also be migrated to the React Framework in the later future.

## Getting Started
Getting started is easy. Our [website](https://techroadmap.netlify.app) is easy to navigate with simplicity but quality as part of our goals.
